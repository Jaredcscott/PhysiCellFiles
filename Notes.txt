If you refer to PhysiCell_constants.h line 136, 146 - 151 the cell phase can be used to determine if the cell is alive and healthy. 
we can loop through the cells, look at the phase, if the phase is 14, then we can add its total volume to the sum of viable bio mass. 

The folder Config_Files cultured_meat should be placed within the /PhysiCell/sample-projects folder. 
The block of text within /Config_Files/makeAddition.txt should be added to /Physicell/sample-projects/Makefile-default

fitness.py should be placed (together with the class Parser.py) within the main /PhysiCell/ directory. 

Limitations in the simulation
  -'Muscle cells' are not not realistic
    -Do not form strands
    -No endpoint attachment to bone cells. 
  -'Feeder cells' are not realistic 
    -Do not link together to form membranes (capilaries) 
    -Infinite supply of resources
  -Only a 2d slice
