If you refer to PhysiCell_constants.h line 136, 146 - 151 the cell phase can be used to determine if the cell is alive and healthy. 
we can loop through the cells, look at the phase, if the phase is 14, then we can add its total volume to the sum of viable bio mass. 

Then the agent can compare the total viable biomass and the inputs which generated it against other episodes. 

wihtin the config .xml there are (to me) 4 adjustable values for our agent. 
1) enviornment oxygen initial condition 
2) nutrient package intial condition
3) starting radius (number of starting cells) 
4) number of nutrient delivery cells
