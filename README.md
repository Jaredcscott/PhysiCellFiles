# Lab Meat/Cell Culture Growth Simulation Optimization 


The folder Config_Files cultured_meat should be placed within the /PhysiCell/sample-projects folder. 
The block of text within /Config_Files/makeAddition.txt should be added to /Physicell/sample-projects/Makefile-default

fitness.py should be placed (together with the class Parser.py) within the main /PhysiCell/ directory. 

Create a file called coords.csv (or use a sample one within the PhysiCellFiles/sample-coords/ folder).
